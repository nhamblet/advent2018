## Day 5: Alchemical Reduction

I had fun with this one. I had stayed up late doing day 4, right up until almost
midnight, so decided to stay up to at least read the problem. I figured it should be
quick enough, so I stayed up and worked on it, and had both parts in about an hour.
Plus, I played with (though didn't make work) some parallelism, and, most fun,
'zipper' constructs.
