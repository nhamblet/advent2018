## Day 6: [Chronal Coordinates](problem.md)

Another fun day, no surprise really. I'm starting to get a little more familiar
with some of the functions I keep looking to use. I feel like I've got a small handful
of little hammers, and keep thinking of problems in ways I can use those hammers,
but it works. I think today was the first day I didn't use any new imports.
