## Advent of Code 2018

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) exercises.
I'm using them as an excuse to play more with haskell, having been
[working through](https://github.com/sumidiot/haskellbook) the
[Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/) this year also. My assigned problem inputs generally
aren't checked in.

I made it through day 11 reasonably strongly, wasn't too crazy about my work in day 12,
didn't get part 1 debugged for day 13, and couldn't make vectors work well in day 14, so
sorta ran out of steam at that point. I'm considering going back through the problems
that I got to throughout next year, to keep learning more things in Haskell, but we'll see.

* [Day 1: Chronal Calibration](day01)
* [Day 2: Inventory Management System](day02)
* [Day 3: No Matter How You Slice It](day03)
* [Day 4: Repose Record](day04)
* [Day 5: Alchemical Reduction](day05)
* [Day 6: Chronal Coordinates](day06)
* [Day 7: The Sum of Its Parts](day07)
* [Day 8: Memory Maneuver](day08)
* [Day 9: Marble Mania](day09)
* [Day 10: The Stars Align](day10)
* [Day 11: Chronal Charge](day11)
* [Day 12: Subterranean Sustainability](day12)
* [Day 13: Mine Cart Madness](day13)
* [Day 14: Choclate Charts](day14)
