## Advent of Code 2018

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) exercises.
Hopefully I'll actually do a handful of the problems, but we'll see. I'll be doing my
solutions in haskell. Each day has the problem statement in it, for convenience. My assigned
problem inputs aren't checked in, except where they fit easily in a line of source code.
