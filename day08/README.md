## Day 8: [Memory Maneuver](problem.md)

Today we parse a list of ints into a tree structure, and then
evaluate the value of a node in the tree based on the value of its children.
Fun problem, and notably less code for me than the previous day. It did take
me a bit of bumbling to work through the recursion.
